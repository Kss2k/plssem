  consistent = TRUE,
  bootstrap = FALSE,
  sample = 50L,
  ordered = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{syntax}{Character string with `lavaan`-style model syntax describing
both measurement (`=~`) and structural (`~`) relations. Random effects are
specified with `(term | cluster)` statements.}

\item{data}{A `data.frame` or coercible object containing the manifest
indicators referenced in `syntax`. Ordered factors are automatically
detected, but can also be supplied explicitly through `ordered`.}

\item{standardize}{Logical; if `TRUE`, indicators are standardized before
estimation so that factor scores have comparable scales.}

\item{consistent}{Logical; `TRUE` requests PLSc corrections, whereas `FALSE`
fits the traditional PLS model.}

\item{bootstrap}{Logical; if `TRUE`, nonparametric bootstrap standard errors
are computed with `sample` resamples.}

\item{sample}{Integer giving the number of bootstrap resamples drawn when
`bootstrap = TRUE`.}

\item{ordered}{Optional character vector naming manifest indicators that
should be treated as ordered when computing polychoric correlations.}

\item{probit}{Logical; overrides the automatic choice of probit factor scores
that is based on whether ordered indicators are present.}

\item{tolerance}{Numeric; Convergence criteria/tolerance.}

\item{max.iter.0_5}{Maximum number of PLS iterations performed when estimating
the measurement and structural models.}

\item{max.iter.0_9}{Maximum number of PLS iterations performed when estimating
the measurement and structural models. Only relevant for interaction
models with ordered data.}

\item{...}{Currently unused, reserved for future extensions.}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of PLS iterations performed when estimating
the measurement and structural models.}
}
\value{
An object of class `plssem` containing the estimated parameters, fit
  measures, factor scores, and any bootstrap results. Methods such as
  `summary()`, `print()`, and `coef()` can be applied to inspect the fit.
}
\description{
`pls()` estimates Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Models (PLS-SEM)
and their consistent (PLSc) variants. The function accepts `lavaan`-style
syntax, handles ordered indicators through polychoric correlations and probit
factor scores, and supports multilevel specifications expressed with
`lme4`-style random effects terms inside the structural model.
